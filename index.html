<p>  <i>New Zealand is blessed with perhaps the world's largest concentration of stunning natural wonders, including bubbling geothermal pools, brooding volcanoes, majestic peaks, dense forests, deep fjords and sunny beaches. A&K handpicks the best of New Zealand to give you the ultimate panorama of this extraordinary destination on an independent journey.

In Rotorua, gaze at the turquoise-blue waters of geothermal pools, a cloud of mist hanging over the water, for a truly otherworldly experience. Head for postcard-perfect Milford Sound, exploring it from an exciting, unique viewpoint - by air. Set off on a jetboat safari on the Dart River, or hike on the shores of the flowing ice river of Franz Josef Glacier.

Yet New Zealand is much more than striking natural landscapes - and on an A&K journey, we unveil the country's cosmopolitan side as well. Discover New Zealand's award-winning restaurants and wineries on a personally crafted culinary tour of the country, or take in the best of Queenstown and Auckland.

Let A&K reveal gorgeous New Zealand exactly the way you want to see it. </i> </p>
